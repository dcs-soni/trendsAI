## Architecture üèóÔ∏è

The architecture of trendsAI is designed to be modular and scalable. The application is structured into several key components:

- **Frontend**: Built with Next.js, the frontend handles user interactions and displays data fetched from the backend.
- **Backend**: The API routes handle requests and responses, interacting with the database through Prisma.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL stores user data, AI applications, models, and votes.

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- PostgreSQL

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trendAI.git
cd trendAI
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

```plaintext
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
GITHUB_ID=your_github_id
GITHUB_SECRET=your_github_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
ADMIN_EMAIL=your_admin_email
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
```

### Run Migrations

Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage üßë‚Äçüíª

1. **Sign Up / Sign In**: Create an account or sign in using OAuth.
2. **Explore AI Tools**: Browse through the list of AI applications and models.
3. **Like and Comment**: Engage with the tools by liking and commenting on them.
4. **Admin Features**: Access the admin dashboard to manage content.

## Code Explanation üìù

### Key Components

#### 1. **User Authentication**

The authentication system is powered by NextAuth.js, which simplifies the process of adding authentication to Next.js applications. Here's a snippet from the `auth.config.ts` file that sets up the authentication providers:

```typescript
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import GoogleProvider from "next-auth/providers/google";
import GitHubProvider from "next-auth/providers/github";

export const authOptions = {
  providers: [
    GoogleProvider({
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
    }),
    GitHubProvider({
      clientId: process.env.GITHUB_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_SECRET,
    }),
  ],
  // Additional configuration options
};
```

This configuration allows users to sign in using their Google or GitHub accounts, enhancing user experience and security.

#### 2. **Data Fetching with Prisma**

The application uses Prisma to interact with the PostgreSQL database. For example, in the `AdminDashboard.tsx`, we fetch AI applications and models:

```typescript
const [aiApps, aiModels, users] = await Promise.all([
  prisma.aIApp.findMany({
    include: {
      _count: {
        select: {
          votes: true,
        },
      },
    },
  }),
  prisma.aIModel.findMany({
    include: {
      _count: {
        select: {
          votes: true,
        },
      },
    },
  }),
  prisma.user.count(),
]);
```

This code retrieves all AI applications and models, along with the total number of users, allowing the admin to have a comprehensive overview of the platform.
